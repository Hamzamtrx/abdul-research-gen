# Supplement Podcast Script Generator

## Overview

Create podcast-style video ad scripts for supplement brands. The goal is to **emulate a real podcast conversation** - not a formulaic ad. Scripts should feel like you're overhearing an authentic moment between real people.

## Before Writing: Required Reading

1. **MANDATORY**: Read `references/winning-patterns.md` for hook formulas, format types, and awareness frameworks
2. **MANDATORY**: Read `references/example-scripts.md` for complete winning script examples across formats
3. Use the input template below to gather product details

## Input Requirements

Before generating a script, gather this information:

### Product Information
```
PRODUCT NAME: [Exact name as shown on website]
BRAND: [Brand name]
WEBSITE: [URL - verify all claims here]
PRICE: [For value framing]
GUARANTEE: [Money-back period, if any]
```

### Mechanism & Science
```
ROOT CAUSE: [What deficiency/imbalance does it address?]
KEY INGREDIENTS: [List 3-5 main ingredients]
HOW IT WORKS: [Simple explanation of the mechanism]
UNIQUE MECHANISM: [Yes/No - Is there something proprietary or different about HOW this works vs competitors?]
IF YES, WHAT IS IT: [Explain the unique mechanism in 1-2 sentences]
NUTRIENT COMPARISONS: [X has Yx more Z than W - need minimum 3]
WHY ALTERNATIVES FAIL: [Why don't multivitamins/other solutions work?]
```

### Target Customer
```
GENDER: [Male/Female/Both]
AGE RANGE: [e.g., 30-55]
PRIMARY SYMPTOMS: [List 3-5 symptoms they're experiencing]
FAILED SOLUTIONS: [What have they already tried?]
EMOTIONAL STATE: [Frustrated? Desperate? Skeptical? Hopeful?]
```

### Brand Context
```
BRAND VOICE: [Clinical / Casual / Edgy / Warm / Authoritative]
FOUNDER STORY: [Is there a compelling origin story? Summarize in 2-3 sentences, or "None"]
KEY DIFFERENTIATOR: [One sentence - why THIS product vs competitors]
PROOF POINTS: [Studies, stats, testimonials, doctor endorsements]
COMMON OBJECTIONS: [What do customers push back on?]
```

### Creative Direction
```
FORMAT: [Friends / Solo Story / Expert Interview / Debate / Accidental Discovery]
AWARENESS LEVEL: [Unaware / Problem Aware / Solution Aware / Most Aware]
MARKET SOPHISTICATION: [Fresh / Moderate / Saturated]
```

---

## Step 0: Explore Personas & Angles (Before Writing)

Before jumping into a script, explore WHO you're talking to and WHAT angle cuts through. The same product can have 5+ completely different scripts for different personas.

### Persona Exploration Framework

Ask: **Who are the distinct buyer types for this product?**

For each persona, identify:
```
PERSONA NAME: [e.g., "Menopause Martha", "Biohacker Ben", "Desperate Dave"]
AGE/GENDER: [Specific, not broad]
LIFE STAGE: [What's happening in their life right now?]
TRIGGER EVENT: [What made this problem urgent?]
FAILED SOLUTIONS: [What have THEY specifically tried?]
TRUSTED SOURCES: [Who do they believe? Doctors? Influencers? Friends?]
LANGUAGE: [How do THEY describe the problem?]
OBJECTION: [What's their specific hesitation?]
```

**Example Personas for a Sleep Supplement:**

| Persona | Trigger | Failed Solutions | Angle |
|---------|---------|------------------|-------|
| Menopause (45-60F) | HRT didn't fix sleep | HRT, magnesium, sleep apps | "HRT fixes hormones, not the 4 pathways it broke" |
| New Dad (30-40M) | Baby destroyed sleep schedule | Melatonin, caffeine cycling | "Your circadian rhythm is shot — here's the reset" |
| Anxious Professional (28-45) | Work stress bleeding into nights | Meditation apps, alcohol, CBD | "Your nervous system is stuck in work mode" |
| Shift Worker (25-50) | Irregular schedule | Blackout curtains, melatonin | "Your body doesn't know when night is anymore" |
| ADHD Brain (20-40) | Racing thoughts won't stop | Prescribed sleep meds, exhaustion | "ADHD brains need different pathways targeted" |

### Angle Ideation Process

Once you have personas, generate angles by asking:

1. **What do they TRUST that isn't working?**
   - "HRT will fix your hot flashes. It won't fix your sleep."
   - "Your doctor says your blood work is fine. Here's what they're missing."

2. **What have they tried that failed — and WHY did it fail?**
   - "Magnesium didn't work because you took the wrong form."
   - "Melatonin made you groggy because it's only one pathway."

3. **What would surprise them?**
   - "Mouth taping sounds insane. Here's why sleep clinics prescribe it."
   - "You're not sleeping badly. You're breathing badly."

4. **What's the SPECIFIC version of their pain?**
   - Generic: "Can't sleep"
   - Specific: "Wide awake at 3 AM, heart racing, replaying conversations"

5. **Who could credibly deliver this message to THEM?**
   - Menopause audience → Female expert who's been through it
   - Biohacker → Data-driven male optimiser
   - Desperate parent → Another parent who fixed it

### Pacing Rules by Awareness Level

**CRITICAL: Sophisticated audiences need FAST pacing.**

| Awareness | Time to Product | Problem Section | Mechanism Depth |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Unaware | 60%+ through script | Long (stack symptoms) | Full education |
| Problem Aware | 40-50% through | Medium (acknowledge) | Explain root cause |
| Solution Aware | 20-30% through | Short (1-2 lines) | Why alternatives fail |
| Most Aware | Immediate | Skip it | Skip it — go to proof |

**Solution Aware Pacing (Saturated Markets):**
- Hook acknowledges what they've tried OR attacks what they trust
- ONE line establishing they have the problem (Host: "I'm on X and still have Y")
- Immediately into mechanism/differentiation
- Product by line 4-5
- No dwelling — they know their pain, don't remind them

**Example of WRONG pacing (Solution Aware):**
```
Hook...
[10 lines about how bad the problem is]
[5 lines about what they've tried]
[Then finally mechanism]
[Then finally product]
```

**Example of RIGHT pacing (Solution Aware):**
```
Hook: "X won't fix your sleep. Here's why."
Host: "I'm on X and still waking up at 3 AM." (ONE LINE)
Expert: [Immediately into mechanism - why X only fixes one piece]
Expert: [Product by line 4-5]
```

### Angle Testing Checklist

Before finalising an angle, verify:
- [ ] Is this angle DIFFERENT from what's already running?
- [ ] Does this persona actually exist in volume?
- [ ] Is the hook specific to THIS persona (not generic)?
- [ ] Does the mechanism explanation matter to THIS persona?
- [ ] Would THIS persona trust the messenger?
- [ ] Is the pacing appropriate for their awareness level?

## Assessing Market Sophistication

Ask: **How sophisticated is this market?**

### Fresh
- Few competitors advertising this type of product
- Audience hasn't seen these hooks before
- Education is welcomed, not met with skepticism
- Direct claims work

### Moderate
- Several competitors in the space
- Audience has seen similar products advertised
- Need to differentiate clearly
- "Why THIS one" matters

### Saturated
- Tons of competitors, major brands involved
- Audience scrolls past these ads daily
- High skepticism, ad fatigue
- Need pattern interrupts and native feel
- Contrarian angles work best

---

## Unique Mechanism Integration

If the product has a unique mechanism, it becomes the CENTERPIECE of the script.

**What counts as a unique mechanism:**
- A proprietary process (freeze-drying, specific extraction)
- A unique ingredient combination others don't have
- A different approach to the problem (dual-action, root cause vs symptom)
- Sourcing or quality difference that affects efficacy

**How to use it in script:**

Structure the education section around WHY this mechanism matters:

```
"Most [category] supplements [common approach].
The problem is [why that doesn't work].
[Product] does something different - [unique mechanism].
That's why [result] happens."
```

**Example (Bloom and Bond - DHT):**
> "Most hair supplements just give you biotin. But if DHT is killing your follicles, there's nothing to feed. Bloom and Bond combines pumpkin seed oil AND saw palmetto - one blocks new DHT, the other shields from existing DHT. Without both, you're solving half the problem."

**Example (Primal Queen - Like Supports Like):**
> "Synthetic multivitamins? Your body doesn't recognize them. Primal Queen uses actual beef organs - liver, heart, ovaries. There's a principle called 'like supports like.' You eat liver to support your liver. You eat ovaries to support your ovaries. Your body knows exactly what to do with it."

If NO unique mechanism exists, focus on:
- Quality/sourcing differentiators
- Social proof and results
- Founder story
- Guarantee/risk reversal

---

## Assessing Awareness Level

If unsure about awareness level, ask: **What does your customer believe RIGHT NOW?**

### Unaware
> "I'm just tired all the time. Probably just getting older."

- They have symptoms but don't connect them
- They're not searching for solutions
- They need to realize they have a PROBLEM first

**Script strategy:** Lead with dramatic story or symptom stack. Don't mention product until 60%+ through.

### Problem Aware
> "Something is definitely wrong with me. My hormones are probably off but I don't know what to do."

- They know something's wrong
- They might know the category (hormones, cortisol, etc.)
- They don't know the ROOT CAUSE or solution

**Script strategy:** Lead with symptoms, reveal root cause as the "aha" moment, then introduce product.

### Solution Aware
> "I've tried biotin, multivitamins, and three different supplements. Nothing works."

- They've actively tried solutions
- They're skeptical because things have failed
- They need to know WHY previous solutions failed

**Script strategy:** Acknowledge failed attempts first, explain the missing piece, position product as different.

### Most Aware
> "I've heard of beef organs / this type of product. Is it actually worth it?"

- They know the product category
- They're comparing options
- They need social proof, results, and the push to buy

**Script strategy:** Lead with results and social proof, minimal education, direct offer with urgency.

## Step 1: Choose Format Type

Pick the format that fits the product and audience:

### Format A: Two Friends Chatting
- Two equals sharing experiences casually
- One has discovered something, sharing with friend
- Natural "girl talk" or "bro chat" energy
- Both can be skeptical or excited
- Dialogue split: 50/50 or 60/40

**Best for:** Relatable products, younger audiences, viral potential

### Format B: Solo Transformation Story
- Single person sharing their journey
- Before/after narrative arc
- Raw, emotional, confessional tone
- First-person throughout

**Best for:** Founder stories, dramatic transformations, problem-aware audiences

### Format C: Expert Interview
- Host asks questions, expert educates
- Authority figure explains mechanism
- Host represents audience's confusion
- Dialogue split: 30/70 (host/expert)

**Best for:** Complex mechanisms, skeptical audiences, health conditions

### Format D: The Debate / Skeptic Challenge
- One person actively pushes back
- Genuine disagreement and resolution
- "Prove it to me" energy
- Arguments get addressed head-on

**Best for:** Saturated markets, skeptical audiences, solution-aware viewers

### Format E: The Accidental Discovery
- Casual conversation where product comes up naturally
- "Wait, what are you taking?"
- Product isn't the focus until it becomes the focus

**Best for:** Unaware audiences, soft sell, native content feel

## Step 2: Identify Awareness Level

This changes EVERYTHING about the script structure:

### Level 1: Unaware
They don't know they have a problem. They're just living with symptoms.

**Script approach:**
- Lead with pattern interrupt or dramatic story
- Stack symptoms they'll recognize ("wait, that's me")
- DON'T mention product until 60% through script
- Focus on problem identification first
- Hook: Story or symptom-based, never product-focused

**Example hook:** "I was planning my funeral at 32. Turns out I just needed to fix one thing."

### Level 2: Problem Aware
They know something's wrong but don't know WHY or what to do.

**Script approach:**
- Lead with symptom stack they relate to
- Reveal the ROOT CAUSE (this is the aha moment)
- Explain mechanism before product
- Product is the answer to the root cause
- Hook: Symptom-focused

**Example hook:** "If you're exhausted but your blood work is 'normal'... your doctor is missing this."

### Level 3: Solution Aware
They know solutions exist. They've probably tried things. Nothing worked.

**Script approach:**
- Acknowledge what they've tried IN THE HOOK or first line
- Explain WHY those solutions failed IMMEDIATELY
- Position product as the missing piece
- Differentiation is key
- Hook: "Why X doesn't work" or attack something they trust
- **PACING: Product by line 4-5. Do NOT dwell on pain — they live it daily.**

**Common mistake:** Spending 30 seconds on problem/pain before getting to mechanism. Solution-aware audiences will scroll. They know their problem — tell them WHY nothing's worked.

**Example hook:** "I wasted 12 weeks on pumpkin seed oil. Here's what my dermatologist didn't tell me."

**Example structure (Solution Aware):**
```
Expert: "HRT fixes your hot flashes. It won't fix your sleep." [HOOK - attacks trusted solution]
Host: "I'm on HRT and still waking up at 3 AM." [ONE LINE - establishes problem]
Expert: "Because menopause breaks four pathways. HRT only fixes one." [IMMEDIATELY mechanism]
[Continue with mechanism → product → proof → CTA]
```

### Level 4: Most Aware
They know the product or category. They just need the push.

**Script approach:**
- Lead with social proof or results
- Specific outcomes and timelines
- Direct offer, guarantee, urgency
- Less education, more validation
- Hook: Results-focused or offer-focused

**Example hook:** "83% of women see results in 3 weeks. Here's what they're not telling you."

## Step 3: Apply Market Sophistication Tactics

Based on your assessment, adjust these elements:

### Fresh Market Tactics
**Mindset:** "They're open and curious"

- ✅ Direct claims land well
- ✅ Simple mechanism explanations work
- ✅ Education is valued and trusted
- ✅ Can mention product name early
- ✅ Standard podcast format works
- ❌ Don't overcomplicate

**Hook style:** Educational, benefit-focused
**Authority:** Credentials matter but aren't critical
**CTA:** Can be more direct

### Moderate Market Tactics
**Mindset:** "They've seen similar stuff"

- ✅ Need clear differentiation ("unlike other brands...")
- ✅ Address "I've seen this before" objection
- ✅ Specific stats and proof points matter more
- ✅ Compare to alternatives they know
- ❌ Don't sound like every other ad

**Hook style:** Differentiation-focused, "what's different about this"
**Authority:** Specific credentials and experience matter
**CTA:** Value framing, why this vs others

### Saturated Market Tactics
**Mindset:** "They're skeptical and ad-fatigued"

- ✅ Pattern interrupts required
- ✅ Native, organic feel is critical
- ✅ Controversy or contrarian angles
- ✅ "Why everything you've tried is wrong"
- ✅ Delay product mention significantly
- ✅ Debate format works well here
- ❌ Avoid obvious ad language entirely
- ❌ Don't use hooks they've seen 100x

**Hook style:** Contrarian, story-driven, unexpected
**Authority:** Must feel authentic, not salesy
**CTA:** Very soft, almost reluctant recommendation

**Saturated market hooks:**
- "I'm about to piss off every dermatologist..."
- "Every influencer is pushing [thing]. Here's why they're wrong."
- "The supplement industry doesn't want you to know this..."
- "I got hate mail for saying this, but..."

## Script Structure (45-90 seconds, 110-200 words)

### Timing Breakdown (Adjust per format)

| Section | Duration | Words | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| Hook | 3-5s | 8-15 | Must stop the scroll |
| Setup/Context | 6-10s | 15-25 | Establish situation or authority |
| Problem/Story | 10-20s | 25-50 | Build tension or relatability |
| Root cause/Mechanism | 10-20s | 25-50 | The "aha" moment |
| Solution intro | 8-12s | 20-30 | Product enters naturally |
| Proof/Validation | 8-12s | 20-30 | Scientific or social proof |
| CTA | 5-8s | 12-20 | Soft close with risk reversal |

### Dialogue Balance by Format

**Two Friends:** 50/50 or 60/40
**Solo Story:** 100% one voice
**Expert Interview:** 30/70 (host/expert)
**Debate:** 45/55 (skeptic gets real airtime)
**Accidental Discovery:** 50/50 shifting to 70/30

```

## Hook Types by Awareness Level

### For Unaware Audiences
**Dramatic Story Hook:**
```
"[Timeframe] ago, I was [desperate situation]. [Shocking detail]. Now [transformation]."
```
Example: "Six months ago I was crying at my wedding dress fitting. Four months later I was a size 4."

**Pattern Interrupt Hook:**
```
"[Shocking statement that makes them stop scrolling]"
```
Example: "I was planning my funeral at 32."

### For Problem Aware Audiences
**Symptom Stack Hook:**
```
"If you [symptom 1], [symptom 2], and [symptom 3]... you might have [root cause]"
```
Example: "If you're exhausted by 2pm, wake up at 3am, and can't lose weight no matter what... your cortisol might be broken."

**"Wait, that's me" Hook:**
```
"Did you know [surprising symptom connection]?"
```
Example: "Did you know that ringing in your ears, cold hands, and afternoon crashes are all connected?"

### For Solution Aware Audiences
**Failed Solution Hook:**
```
"I wasted [time/money] on [solution]. Here's what [authority] didn't tell me."
```
Example: "I wasted 12 weeks on biotin. Here's what my dermatologist missed."

**"Why X Doesn't Work" Hook:**
```
"[Solution] only solves half the problem. Here's the other half no one talks about."
```
Example: "Pumpkin seed oil only blocks NEW DHT. It does nothing to the DHT already killing your follicles."

### For Most Aware Audiences
**Results Hook:**
```
"[Specific stat] of [users] see [result] in [timeframe]."
```
Example: "83% of women see their shedding stop within 3 weeks."

**Social Proof Hook:**
```
"[Authority figure] said '[quote about results]'"
```
Example: "My doctor asked what medication I'm on. It's just this."

**Direct Offer Hook:**
```
"[Product] is [offer] right now. [Urgency reason]."
```

## Required Script Elements

### 1. Authority Mechanism (Required)
Establish WHY Host 2 knows this:
- "As a functional practitioner..."
- "I've been recommending this for years..."
- "From my Ayurvedic background..."
- "Working with thousands of patients..."

### 2. Bridge Phrase (Required)
Transition to root cause:
- "You've probably heard of [X]... but what you haven't heard is..."
- "Here's what no one talks about..."
- "Here's what's actually happening..."

### 3. Mechanism Education (Required)
Explain the body process:
```
"As you age, [process stops working] because [deficiency].
Without [nutrient], [consequence] which causes [symptoms].
That's why [solution] works because [mechanism]."
```

### 4. Scientific Comparisons (Minimum 3)
Format: "[Ingredient] has [X]x more [nutrient] than [common food]"
- Must be verifiable
- Use dramatic multipliers (23x, 100x, 14,000x)

### 5. Transformation Timeline
Be specific about when results happen:
- "Within the first few weeks..."
- "By week 3, you'll notice..."
- "A month in, you're..."

### 6. Soft CTA with Risk Reversal
- Mention guarantee (365-day, etc.)
- Include any free gifts/bonuses
- "Nothing to lose" framing

## Forbidden Elements

**Never use:**
- "Amazing", "game-changer", "revolutionary", "miracle", "secret", "hack"
- Generic openings ("Hey guys, so today...")
- Weak authority ("I'm not an expert but...")
- Vague benefits ("It makes you feel better")

- Variation A: Dramatic story hook
- Variation B: Pattern interrupt hook
- Variation C: "This changed everything" hook

**For Problem Aware:**
- Variation A: Symptom stack hook

- Variation B: "Why X doesn't work" hook
- Variation C: Missing piece hook

**For Most Aware:**
- Variation A: Results/stats hook
- Variation B: Social proof hook
- Variation C: Direct offer hook

## MTRX Script Standards (Critical)

Every script MUST meet these standards. Bland scripts get rejected.

### 1. Hypothesis Block (Required)

Every script MUST begin with a hypothesis block that states what's being tested:

```
**HYPOTHESIS**
- Angle: [What core idea/claim are we testing?]
- Awareness Level: [Unaware / Problem Aware / Solution Aware / Most Aware]
- Market Sophistication: [Fresh / Moderate / Saturated]
- Format: [Friends / Solo Story / Expert Interview / Debate / Accidental Discovery]
```

**Example:**
```
**HYPOTHESIS**
- Angle: Sleep supplements fail because they only address one of four pathways
- Awareness Level: Solution Aware (tried magnesium, melatonin, didn't work)
- Market Sophistication: Saturated (everyone's seen sleep supplement ads)
- Format: Expert Interview
```

This makes testing clear. When a script wins or loses, you know exactly what variable to attribute it to.

### 2. Aggressive Hooks Only

**Never write bland question hooks like:**
- "I tried X for sleep. It didn't work. What am I missing?"
- "Have you ever wondered why..."
- "Did you know that..."

**Instead, write hooks that make declarative, aggressive claims:**
- "[Specific ingredient] is the ONLY [form] that actually works for [problem]"
- "Every [product category] you've tried is using the wrong [ingredient/form]"
- "Your [authority figure] is wrong about [common belief]"

The hook should feel like someone confidently stating a fact, not asking a question or making a weak observation.

### 3. Name Specific Enemies

Never use vague language like "everything else" or "other products." Name the specific thing that's wrong.

**Vague (avoid):**
> "Everything else—oxide, citrate—your body barely absorbs it."

**Specific (use):**
> "Magnesium oxide is in every cheap sleep supplement. Your body absorbs about 4% of it."

Name the exact ingredient, form, or product type that's failing them. This creates recognition ("Oh, that's what I've been taking").

### 4. Vivid Language Over Clinical Language

Replace clinical/boring descriptions with visceral, memorable language.

**Clinical (forgettable):**
> "Your body barely absorbs it"
> "Low bioavailability"
> "Inefficient absorption"

**Vivid (memorable):**
> "You're literally pissing it out"
> "The rest goes straight down the toilet"
> "Your body doesn't know what to do with it, so it dumps it"

Make them FEEL the waste, the frustration, the problem. Clinical language gets scrolled past.

### 5. The "Only X, But Even That's Not Enough" Structure

For solution-aware audiences, use this progression:

```
1. Declare the ONLY correct solution (aggressive claim)
   → "[Ingredient form] is the only [category] that actually [benefit]"

2. Immediately undercut it - even that's incomplete
   → "But even then, you're only addressing [one pathway]"
   → "That handles [X], but what about [Y] and [Z]?"

3. Stack the additional requirements
   → "You also need [ingredient] for [specific function]"
   → "Plus [ingredient] to [specific function]"
   → "And [ingredient] because [mechanism]"

4. Land on the product as the complete solution
   → "[Product] stacks all of them"

5. Price/value as the closer
   → "And you can get it for [price]" or "Cheaper than buying them separately"
```

### 6. Bridging & Flow

Scripts must flow naturally. Each section should bridge to the next.

**How to bridge between sections:**

Use the Host to create natural transitions:
- "So that's pathway one." → prompts Expert to continue
- "What's the second one?" → moves to next point
- "Okay, so what do I actually do about it?" → transitions to solution

**Walking through complex information:**

When explaining multiple things (like multiple pathways or ingredients), break them up with Host prompts:

**Bad (info dump):**
> Expert: "You need L-theanine to drop cortisol before bed. Glycine to lower your core temperature. Apigenin to quiet the mental chatter. Tart cherry for natural melatonin."

**Good (paced with prompts):**
> Expert: "First pathway: your nervous system. Magnesium calms it down."
> Host: "So that's pathway one."
> Expert: "Right. Pathway two: cortisol. L-theanine drops it."
> Host: "What's three?"
> Expert: "Core body temperature. Glycine cools you down—that's what triggers deep sleep."
> Host: "And four?"
> Expert: "The racing mind. Apigenin quiets that."

Each piece gets its own moment. The viewer can follow along.

### 7. Assume the Viewer is a Dummy

Never assume the viewer is following your logic. Spell out the implication explicitly.

**Bad:**
> Host: "So I need four different supplements?"

**Good:**
> Host: "So to actually sleep through the night, I need to go buy four different supplements?"

The second version connects the dots for them: four supplements → desired outcome.

**More examples:**

Bad: "So magnesium isn't enough?"
Good: "So even if I'm taking magnesium, I still won't sleep through the night?"

Bad: "That's a lot of ingredients."
Good: "So to fix all four pathways, I'd need to buy four different bottles?"

Always state the implication + the outcome they care about.

### 8. Smooth Product Introductions

The product mention should feel like a helpful recommendation, not a sales pitch.

**Jarring:**
> Expert: "Or one. DremTeam stacks all of them."

**Smooth:**
> Expert: "Or if you want a cheaper alternative, I recommend DremTeam. They stack all of them."

**Permission phrases that work:**
- "If you want a cheaper alternative, I recommend..."
- "The one I recommend to my patients is..."
- "The only brand I've found that actually does this is..."
- "There's one company that figured this out..."

These create permission to mention the product without feeling like a pivot to sales mode.

### 9. Unique Character Requirement

Every script must have a distinct personality or angle. Ask: "What makes THIS script different from every other supplement ad?"

**Ways to create unique character:**
- Contrarian positioning ("Everyone's wrong about...")
- Insider knowledge ("What sleep clinics actually prescribe...")
- Aggressive confidence ("This is the only thing that works. Period.")
- Specific enemy ("The supplement industry uses [cheap ingredient] because...")
- Unexpected comparison ("You'd need to eat 47 bananas to get what's in this")

If the script could be about ANY supplement with minor word changes, it's too generic. Reject it.

### 10. Clear Reason to Buy

Every script must answer: "Why should I buy THIS product specifically?"

**Weak reasons (avoid):**
- "It works" (so does everything else supposedly)
- "Natural ingredients" (generic)
- "Helps you sleep better" (every sleep product claims this)

**Strong reasons (use):**
- "Only brand that combines [specific differentiator]"
- "Uses [superior form] while competitors use [inferior form]"
- "Complete system vs single ingredient"
- "£X cheaper than buying the stack separately"
- "[Specific guarantee] so nothing to lose"

### 11. Script Self-Check

Before finalizing any script, verify:
- [ ] Hypothesis block completed (angle, awareness, sophistication, format)
- [ ] Hook makes an aggressive, declarative claim (not a question)
- [ ] Specific enemies named (not "everything else")
- [ ] Vivid language used (not clinical/boring descriptions)
- [ ] Complex info broken into pieces with Host prompts (not info dumps)
- [ ] Script has a unique angle/character that couldn't apply to competitors
- [ ] Clear "why THIS product" reason stated explicitly
- [ ] Implications spelled out for the viewer (assume they're not following)
- [ ] Product intro feels like a recommendation, not a pitch
- [ ] Price/value or guarantee mentioned
- [ ] Script flows with natural bridges between sections
- [ ] Would stop someone mid-scroll? If not, rewrite the hook.

## Compliance Notes

- Only use claims present on brand website
- If information contradicts between brief and website, trust website
- Better to be vague than wrong
- Qualify health claims: "may help", "supports", "associated with"
- Never mention competitors by name negatively
