## FORMAT: Two Friends Chatting

### Example: Beef Organs - Friends Discovery
**Awareness Level:** Problem Aware
**Format:** Two Friends (50/50 split)

---

**Friend 1:** Wait, hold the phone. You're saying that all women aged over 30 will have higher energy, they'll reset their hormone, and have higher libido if they eat beef organs?

**Friend 2:** I don't know how many times I need to explain this to you. So beef organs and the amount of vitamins and nutrients that it holds is crazy.

A beef liver, kidney, uterus has astronomical amounts of B12, iron, vitamin A.

If you think about it, it's nature's natural multivitamin. I mean, we've been taking them for thousands of years because it gets to the root cause of these issues.

**Friend 1:** Okay, but if you need to fix your hormones, why don't you just like take more greens, you know, make smoothies, or take a freaking multivitamin?

**Friend 2:** No, see, that's not gonna work because all of that is synthetic. The thing with these multivitamins is that it's all natural and your body knows how to register it. So it knows how to absorb it. Instead of all that fake stuff that your body just has no idea what to do with.

**Friend 1:** Where am I even meant to get beef organs from? It's not like I can just go into a shop and buy ovaries or a uterus.

**Friend 2:** Yeah, that's a good question. I mean, I, as a woman, am not trying to eat actual raw beef organs.

**Friend 1:** Okay, so you're saying you don't eat them then?

**Friend 2:** No, I take two capsules, they're freeze-dried, and you're losing none of the nutrients.

**Friend 1:** Okay, but how does your body even know that it's for women?

**Friend 2:** Okay, so you're not listening.

**Friend 1:** Make it make sense.

**Friend 2:** So I'll try, I'll do my best here. So I take the ones by Primal Queen, and their blend is liver, heart, kidney, ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes. I know, it sounds weird, but science says that like for like, when you eat an organ, it actually helps that organ.

Okay. Yeah, so if you eat a uterus, it's helping your own uterus by giving it a B12 boost and managing those hormones.

**Friend 1:** Do you have them on you?

**Friend 2:** I do, and I'm gonna do you a favor. You can take mine. Try them for a month, and if you don't like them, there's a 365-day money-back guarantee.

**Friend 1:** You know what? The ingredients actually look interesting, and I am taking like nine supplements at the moment.

**Friend 2:** That's too much, why are you doing that? Yeah, honestly, I don't know, but this might actually be better for me. You know what, I'll try it. I'll let you know how I get on.

---

**Why it works:**
- Equal energy between friends (not expert/student)
- Natural skepticism and pushback
- "Make it make sense" = real friend energy
- Objections addressed organically
- Comparison to 9 supplements = instant value prop
- 365-day guarantee at the end

## FORMAT: Solo Transformation Story

### Example: Founder Origin Story
**Awareness Level:** Unaware
**Format:** Solo Story (100% one voice)

---

I was about to be admitted to a mental asylum. After college, I was struggling with my weight, and had brain fog so bad I couldn't remember conversations from an hour before. I was desperate and tried everything. Spent $300 on keto meal plans, lost 5 pounds, gained back 8. Dropped $150 a month on collagen powders that were pushed then. They didn't work either.

So, I researched obsessively and discovered that our ancestors didn't really deal with obesity like we did, and it's because of the nutrients they had, most of which they got from eating the entire cow. They prioritized organs because that's where all the life-giving nutrients live.

So, I tried it. And the first time, my best friend walked in on me eating raw beef liver straight from the butcher. She literally screamed and thought I'd had a complete mental breakdown.

But I kept going. My friends and family thought I had gone crazy, but they didn't understand that beef liver has 100 times more vitamin A than carrots. Beef heart contains 14,000 times more CoQ10 than broccoli. Beef uterus has the same hormones that regulate women's cycles.

And it worked. The results were undeniable. Within two weeks, the brain fog lifted completely. My energy went from a zombie to, like, a superhuman. The same friends who called me crazy were now begging to know my secret.

But eating raw organs every day was absolutely disgusting. I was gagging through every bite. That's when I started freeze drying these organs into capsules. I tested them on myself for months, and that's how Primal Queen was born.

From a crazy woman who was willing to eat disgusting raw organs because she refused to accept feeling broken forever. Today, thousands of women are fixing their hormones and transforming their lives, all because I was willing to do what everyone thought was insane.

## FORMAT: Expert Interview

### Example: Doctor Explains Weight Loss
**Awareness Level:** Problem Aware to Solution Aware
**Format:** Expert Interview (30/70 host/expert)

---

**Host:** Did you know that when you get a hysterectomy, where your ovaries are removed, your body goes into instant menopause?

Estrogen? Gone. Progesterone? Gone. Testosterone? Gone.

And that crash can leave you with hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, anxiety, brain fog, low libido, weight gain, brittle hair, dry skin, and a deep exhaustion that no nap can fix.

Doctors usually prescribe HRT… synthetic hormones made in a lab. But for a lot of women, it doesn't feel right. And for some, it makes things worse.

That's exactly why Shelby created Primal Queen.

**Co-host:** Not because she had a hysterectomy, but because she saw thousands of women struggling with the same hormonal issues, and no one was offering a natural, effective alternative?

**Host:** Yeah exactly, she turned to ancestral nutrition… the idea that if you nourish your body the way women did for thousands of years, you give it the tools to heal.

**Co-host:** What did she find?

**Host:** She found there's a principle in natural medicine… especially in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Indigenous cultures… called "like supports like."

If you want to support your liver, you eat liver. If you want to support your heart, you eat heart. If you want to support your ovaries… you eat beef ovaries.

Even if your own ovaries are gone, those organs still contain the exact nutrients your body needs to produce, regulate, and balance estrogen, progesterone, and other key hormones.

Beef ovaries contain precursors to estrogen. Beef uterus is loaded with B12 and folate. Beef liver provides retinol the active form of vitamin A plus iron and copper to support energy, skin, and thyroid function. Beef kidney supports detox. Beef heart supports circulation and stress resilience.

Shelby combined six of the most powerful organs into one daily supplement: Freeze-dried raw for maximum potency. Sourced from grass-fed, pasture-raised cattle. Designed specifically for women's hormones.

**Co-host:** Does it actually work?

**Host:** Women are reporting better moods, clearer skin, deeper sleep, higher libido, and more stable cycles, even without it being made specifically for post-menopause and post-hysterectomy.

And they're doing it without HRT.

This is about giving your body the raw materials it needs to function like it was designed to.

**Co-host:** Wow, so you'd recommend it for women struggling with Hysterectomy

**Host:** I would consider it yeah, there's a 365 day guarantee too, a lot of supplements don't have that.

I've spoken to Shelby too. This isn't another cash grab, it's about helping women in a way they deserve rather than being exploited by Big Pharma.

Another thing I recommend is…

---

**Why it works:**
- Specific medical condition = targeted audience
- Symptom stack in opening (hot flashes, night sweats, etc.)
- "Like supports like" mechanism
- Each organ mapped to specific benefit
- Anti-Big Pharma positioning
- Soft CTA with guarantee

### Example: Starvation Mode Mechanism
**Awareness Level:** Problem Aware
**Format:** Expert Interview (Patient + Doctor)

---

**Emily:** Six months ago, I was crying at my wedding dress fitting because the seamstress couldn't zip me in. Four months later, I was a size 4. But I still don't understand how it actually worked. My only real change was consuming beef organs through a supplement called Primal Queen.

**Doctor:** Tell me what you were doing before Primal Queen.

**Emily:** Everything! Keto for three months, those expensive fat burner pills, working out twice a day, eating 1200 calories. I was having breakdowns every week and barely losing anything.

**Doctor:** I see this all the time. Typically what this means is your key hormones - estrogen, progesterone, cortisol - were completely screwed up.

Were you crash dieting before?

**Emily:** Yes I was always on and off

**Doctor:** That lines up, most likely years of crash dieting, wedding stress, and being nutrient deficient made your body think it was starving.

**Emily:** So even though I was doing everything right...

**Doctor:** Your body went into survival mode. It slowed your metabolism and held onto every bit of fat thinking 'What if we need this later?'

That's why 1200 calories and working out twice a day did nothing. Without the right nutrients, your body couldn't get the signal that it was safe and shed off the weight.

**Emily:** Wait, so how did Primal Queen fix that?

**Doctor:** You finally gave your body what it was desperately missing.

Nutrients.

Beef organs are nature's original multivitamin.

The amount of nutrients in let's say a beef liver is crazy.

Beef liver has 100x more B12 than spinach

Beef heart has 14,000x more COQ10 than cauliflower

Even beef fallopian tubes have nearly 12x more Zinc than broccoli.

All these nutrients ensured your hormones and processes were working as they should

Which in turn told your body 'We're safe now, stop panicking.'

**Emily:** So my body stopped thinking it was starving?

**Doctor:** Exactly. Your thyroid fired up again - that's why your energy came back and your metabolism started working normally.

And the beef ovaries and uterus? They contain the exact nutrients that rebalance estrogen and progesterone - the hormones that control your cycle, mood, and how your body stores fat.

**Emily:** So my hormones were literally broken and that's why nothing worked?

**Doctor:** Correct. It wasn't willpower. It wasn't your fault. Your hormones control everything - weight, mood, energy, confidence. When they're broken, you're fighting a losing battle.

**Emily:** This makes so much sense now! I thought I was just lazy or broken.

**Doctor:** You know, with the current state of American women, I'd be surprised if this didn't work for at least 70% of the population.

It all comes down to just fixing the root cause.

**Emily:** I would try it, 365 day money back guarantee, 4 free gifts. You have nothing to lose really.

---

**Why it works:**
- Emotional hook (crying at wedding fitting)
- Doctor authority validates the mechanism
- "Starvation mode" explanation is memorable
- Clear before/after (couldn't zip → size 4)
- "Not your fault" removes shame
- 70% stat creates mass appeal

## FORMAT: Expert Interview (Solution Aware)

### Example: Hair Loss - DHT Mechanism
**Awareness Level:** Solution Aware (failed solutions hook)
**Format:** Expert Interview (Host + Specialist)

---

**Host:** My dermatologist said pumpkin seed oil would stop my shedding. It's been 12 weeks. Nothing's changed.

Women are wasting months on pumpkin seed oil with no results. Why isn't it working?

**Expert:** Pumpkin seed oil alone only blocks new DHT production. It does nothing to the DHT already strangling your follicles. If you're pulling clumps from your drain, that's DHT killing your hair. Estrogen used to protect you from this, but as we age, that protection vanishes. I see women lose 40% of their volume in months.

**Host:** But I thought biotin and those hair vitamins were supposed to help with that?

**Expert:** Biotin and vitamin supplements feed your hair follicles. But if DHT is murdering them, there's nothing to feed.

**Host:** So I need something stronger than pumpkin seed oil?

**Expert:** You need pumpkin seed oil plus saw palmetto. Pumpkin seed oil blocks new DHT and saw palmetto shields from existing DHT. Without both, you're solving half the problem.

**Host:** Is there a brand that you recommend?

**Expert:** The only brand I know that combines both in the right amounts without fillers or junk is Bloom and Bond. It's the only supplement I recommend to my patients with excessive shedding.

**Host:** And you're seeing actual results with your patients?

**Expert:** 83% of my patients see their shedding reduce within the first few weeks, and by three months, they're noticing baby hairs growing back along their hairline and part.

**Host:** Do I take this forever like minoxidil?

**Expert:** No, this restores what estrogen used to naturally do. No dependency. But every week you wait, more follicles die permanently. The ones you save now recover. The ones that die while you're deciding are gone forever.

---

**Why it works:**
- Specific problem (12 weeks, no results) = SOLUTION AWARE hook
- Clear mechanism (DHT strangling follicles)
- Explains why alternatives fail
- Dual-action solution is memorable
- 83% stat with specific timeline
- Urgency without pressure (follicles dying)

## FORMAT: Debate / Skeptic Challenge

### Example: Skeptic Pushback on Beef Organs
**Awareness Level:** Solution Aware (skeptical, tried things)
**Format:** Debate (45/55 skeptic/advocate)

---

**Skeptic:** I'm not eating cow ovaries. That's insane. You're telling me eating a cow's uterus is going to fix my hormones? That sounds made up.

**Advocate:** I know how it sounds. I literally said the same thing six months ago. But think about it - for thousands of years, women weren't dealing with the hormone issues we have now. What changed?

**Skeptic:** I don't know, stress? Processed food?

**Advocate:** Yeah, but also - we stopped eating the whole animal. Our ancestors ate everything. Liver, heart, kidneys. And those organs are packed with nutrients we can't get anywhere else.

**Skeptic:** But can't I just take a multivitamin?

**Advocate:** I tried that. For years. Here's the problem - synthetic vitamins aren't the same. Your body doesn't recognize them. It's like giving your body a fake key and expecting the door to open.

**Skeptic:** Okay but why specifically beef ORGANS? Why not just beef?

**Advocate:** Because that's where the nutrients live. Beef liver alone has 100x more B12 than spinach. Beef heart has 14,000x more CoQ10 than vegetables. The uterus and ovaries contain the exact precursors your body needs to balance estrogen and progesterone.

**Skeptic:** That's... actually kind of logical. Like supports like?

**Advocate:** Exactly. Traditional Chinese Medicine has known this forever. Eat heart to support heart. Eat liver to support liver.

**Skeptic:** But I'm not eating raw organs. That's where I draw the line.

**Advocate:** Neither am I. I take two capsules. Freeze-dried. No taste. You're getting everything without the gross factor.

**Skeptic:** And this actually worked for you?

**Advocate:** Three weeks in, my brain fog cleared. A month later, my energy was back. I stopped waking up at 3am. And I replaced like nine different supplements with one bottle.

**Skeptic:** Okay... what's the brand?

**Advocate:** Primal Queen. And they have a 365-day guarantee so you can actually test it properly.

**Skeptic:** A YEAR? That's actually crazy.

**Advocate:** That's how confident they are. Look, I was skeptical too. Just try it.

---

**Why it works:**
- Skeptic voices REAL objections ("that's insane")
- Each objection gets a real answer
- Advocate doesn't dismiss - validates first ("I said the same thing")
- Logical progression of objections
- "Like supports like" becomes the turning point
- Skeptic conversion feels earned, not forced
- 365-day guarantee lands harder after skepticism

## FORMAT: Accidental Discovery

### Example: Friend Notices Transformation
**Awareness Level:** Unaware (product discovery is organic)
**Format:** Accidental Discovery (50/50)

---

**Person 1:** Okay I have to ask - your skin has been glowing lately. What are you doing?

**Person 2:** Oh, really? I don't know, I haven't changed much honestly.

**Person 1:** No, like, seriously. And you seem less... tired? Like you used to complain about being exhausted all the time.

**Person 2:** Oh! Actually yeah, I did start taking something a few months ago. My naturopath recommended it.

**Person 1:** What is it?

**Person 2:** It's gonna sound weird. It's like... freeze-dried beef organs.

**Person 1:** Wait, what?

**Person 2:** I know, I know. But apparently our ancestors ate the whole animal and that's where all the nutrients are. Like the liver has insane amounts of B12 and vitamin A. The heart has this thing called CoQ10.

**Person 1:** And you just... swallow them?

**Person 2:** It's just capsules. You don't taste anything. I was skeptical but honestly after like three weeks I noticed my energy was different. And then my cycle got more regular. And then apparently my skin is glowing now?

**Person 1:** Okay you need to send me the link.

**Person 2:** It's called Primal Queen. They have this crazy 365-day guarantee too so I figured why not try it. Nothing to lose really.

**Person 1:** Adding to cart right now.

---

**Why it works:**
- Product discovery is completely organic
- Opens with visible result (social proof)
- Person 2 is almost surprised by their own transformation
- Mechanism education feels natural (explaining to friend)
- No "sales pitch" energy
- CTA happens naturally ("send me the link")
- Perfect for UNAWARE audiences who need soft introduction

## FORMAT: Expert Interview (MTRX Standards Example)

### Example: Sleep - Four Pathways Angle
**Awareness Level:** Solution Aware (tried magnesium, melatonin, didn't work)
**Format:** Expert Interview (Host + Expert)
**Market Sophistication:** Saturated

---

**HYPOTHESIS**
- Angle: Sleep supplements fail because they only address one of four pathways
- Awareness Level: Solution Aware
- Market Sophistication: Saturated
- Format: Expert Interview

---

**Expert:** Every sleep supplement you've tried has the same problem. They fix one thing and ignore the other three.

**Host:** What do you mean?

**Expert:** Sleep isn't one system. It's four. And if even one is broken, you're not sleeping through the night.

**Host:** Okay, walk me through them.

**Expert:** First pathway: your nervous system. It needs to calm down before you can even start falling asleep. That's what magnesium does—but it has to be bisglycinate. Magnesium oxide, the cheap stuff? You absorb 4%. The rest you piss out.

**Host:** So that's pathway one.

**Expert:** Right. Pathway two: cortisol. That's your stress hormone. If it's still elevated at night, your body thinks it's daytime. L-theanine drops it.

**Host:** What's three?

**Expert:** Core body temperature. Your body needs to cool down to enter deep sleep. Glycine does that. Most people have never even heard of it.

**Host:** And four?

**Expert:** The racing mind. Thoughts won't stop. Apigenin quiets that—it's basically nature's version of a sedative, without the grogginess.

**Host:** So to actually sleep through the night, I need to go buy four different supplements?

**Expert:** Or if you want a cheaper alternative, I recommend DremTeam. They stack all of them. Plus mouth tape and nasal strips—nasal breathing affects your REM directly. It's £19 for the complete system. 30-night guarantee if it doesn't work.

**Host:** That's cheaper than the magnesium that didn't do anything.

**Expert:** Because that magnesium was only fixing one pathway. This fixes all four.

---

**Why it works (MTRX Standards):**
- **Hypothesis block:** Clear angle, awareness, sophistication, format stated
- **Aggressive hook:** "Every sleep supplement you've tried has the same problem" - declarative, not a question
- **Specific enemy named:** "Magnesium oxide, the cheap stuff" - not vague "other products"
- **Vivid language:** "You piss out" instead of "low absorption"
- **Bridging & flow:** Host prompts each transition ("So that's pathway one" / "What's three?")
- **Complex info paced:** Four pathways broken into individual exchanges, not dumped at once
- **Dummy-proof:** "So to actually sleep through the night, I need to go buy four different supplements?" - spells out implication
- **Smooth product intro:** "Or if you want a cheaper alternative, I recommend..." - permission phrase
- **Clear reason to buy:** Complete system, £19, 30-night guarantee, cheaper than what failed
- **Closes the loop:** "Because that magnesium was only fixing one pathway" - ties back to hook

---

### Hook Variations for A/B Testing:

**Variation A:**
"Every sleep supplement you've tried has the same problem. They fix one thing and ignore the other three."

**Variation B:**
"Sleep isn't one system. It's four. Miss one and you're staring at the ceiling all night."

**Variation C:**
"You've tried magnesium. Melatonin. Teas. They all failed for the same reason."
