# Supplement UGC Script Generator

## Overview

Create UGC (user-generated content) style video ad scripts. Unlike podcast ads with two hosts, UGC is **one person talking directly to camera**. The goal is authentic, native content that feels like a real person sharing their experience - not an ad.

## Before Writing: Required Reading

1. **MANDATORY**: Read `references/winning-patterns.md` for format types, hook formulas, and visual cue standards
2. **MANDATORY**: Read `references/example-scripts.md` for complete winning scripts with production notes

```

---

## Step 1: Choose UGC Format

### Format A: Transformation Story
Single person shares their before/after journey. Emotional, raw, personal.

**Structure:**
1. Hook showing transformation or low point
2. "This was me [timeframe] ago..."
3. What I tried that didn't work
4. Discovery moment (how I found product)
5. Mechanism education (why this worked)
6. Results timeline (week 1, week 2...)
7. Emotional payoff
8. Soft CTA

**Best for:** Problem aware audiences, dramatic results, relatable stories

**Example hook:** "Six months ago, I couldn't walk across a room without holding onto furniture."

---

### Format B: Reverse Selling
"Don't buy this unless..." - Confident, almost arrogant. Reverse psychology.

**Structure:**
1. Hook: "Don't buy X if you're happy with Y"
2. Challenge: "Because once you try this, you can't go back"
3. Product benefits (framed as warnings)
4. Competitor comparison (why theirs sucks)
5. Future pacing: "Let me tell you what happens in 6 months..."
6. Social proof moment
7. Return to reverse frame
8. CTA: "So yeah, don't buy this unless..."

**Best for:** Saturated markets, confident products, younger audiences

**Example hook:** "Do NOT buy these fitted shirts if you're happy with BYLT, True Classic, or Lululemon."

---

### Format C: Medical Story / Expert Authority
Person shares health crisis or has medical credibility (nurse, practitioner, or "my doctor told me").

**Structure:**
1. Hook: Dramatic health moment or credential
2. The crisis/problem in detail
3. What doctor/expert said
4. Why common solutions fail
5. The discovery (product)
6. Mechanism with authority backing
7. Results + proof point ("I ran out and pain came back")
8. CTA with urgency

**Best for:** Older demographics, health products, skeptical audiences

**Example hook:** "My cardiologist's face went pale when he saw what I'd been drinking with my medication."

---

### Format D: 30-Day Results
"What happens if you do X for 30 days" - Educational, progressive results.

**Structure:**
1. Hook: "Here's what actually happens to your [problem] if you [solution] for 30 days"
2. Explain the mechanism briefly
3. Week 1 results
4. Week 2 results
5. Week 3 results
6. Week 4 payoff (the big transformation)
7. Personal validation: "I know because I lived it"
8. Product intro + CTA

**Best for:** Visual transformations, skeptical audiences who want proof timeline

**Example hook:** "Here's what actually happens to your chubby face if you eat beef organs for 30 days."

---

### Format E: Stitch to Viral
React to another video/testimonial, add your experience or expert take.

**Structure:**
1. Hook: Show/reference viral clip
2. "If anyone sees this woman, tell her I'm looking for her"
3. Your skepticism: "I thought she was lying..."
4. What you tried
5. Your results
6. Side-by-side or before/after moment
7. CTA

**Best for:** Social proof amplification, trend-jacking, solution aware audiences

**Example hook:** "If anyone sees this woman right here, tell her I'm looking for her. Because thanks to what she said..."

---

## Step 2: Identify Awareness Level

### Unaware
- Lead with dramatic story or symptoms
- Don't mention product until 60%+ through
- Focus on problem identification

### Problem Aware
- Lead with symptom stack
- Reveal root cause as the "aha" moment
- Product solves the root cause

### Solution Aware
- Acknowledge what they've tried
- Explain why those failed
- Differentiate your product

### Most Aware
- Lead with results and social proof
- Minimal education
- Direct offer with urgency

---

## Step 3: Apply Market Sophistication

### Fresh Market
- Direct claims work
- Education is welcomed
- Can be more "salesy"

### Moderate Market
- Need differentiation
- "Why THIS one" matters
- Compare to alternatives

### Saturated Market
- Pattern interrupts required
- Native feel is critical
- Reverse selling works well
- Avoid obvious ad language

---

## Script Structure (45-90 seconds)

### Timing Breakdown

| Section | Duration | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Hook | 3-5s | Must stop scroll |
| Problem/Story setup | 10-20s | Build relatability |
| Failed solutions | 5-10s | Validate their experience |
| Discovery/Mechanism | 15-25s | The education |
| Results/Proof | 10-15s | Transformation timeline |
| CTA | 5-10s | Soft close |

### Word Count
- 45 seconds ≈ 110-125 words
- 60 seconds ≈ 140-165 words
- 90 seconds ≈ 200-240 words

---

## Hook Requirements

Generate **2-3 hook variations** per script.

### Hook Types:

**Visual Hook:** Start with physical demonstration
```
[shows swollen ankles]
"If your ankles look like this..."
```

**Transformation Hook:** Before/after contrast
```
"Six months ago, I was a size 14. Today I'm a size 4."
```

**Pattern Interrupt:** Unexpected statement
```
"My cardiologist's face went pale when he saw what I was drinking."
```

**Reverse Sell Hook:** Don't buy framing
```
"Do NOT buy this if you're happy with [competitor]."
```

**Symptom Stack Hook:** List relatable symptoms
```
"If you're dizzy when you stand up, peeing 10 times a night, and your ankles are swollen..."
```

**Challenge Hook:** Dare the viewer
```
"Here's what happens to your face if you eat beef organs for 30 days."
```

---

## Visual Cues & Action Directions

Include visual cues throughout the script in brackets:

### Action Cues
```
[shows swollen ankles]
[holds up product]
[points at camera]
[shows before photo]
[demonstrates movement]
[takes capsules with water]
```

### Camera Position Cues
```
[selfie style - close up]
[phone set down - medium shot]
[walking and talking]
[sitting on bed edge]
```

### Emotional Cues
```
[gets emotional]
[frustrated tone]
[excited, faster pace]
[quiet, serious]
[confident smirk]
```

### Product Interaction Cues
```
[rattles bottle]
[reads label]
[shows ingredients]
[holds up to camera]
```

---

## B-Roll List Requirements

Every script should include a B-roll list for the editor:

**Standard B-roll needs:**
1. Before state (re-enactment of problem)
2. After state (showing improvement)
3. Product hero shot (clean, well-lit)
4. Product in use (taking capsules, mixing powder)
5. Lifestyle shot (with family, being active)
6. Failed solution visual (old supplements, competitor product)

**Format as:**
```
B-ROLL NEEDED:
1. [Description of shot]
2. [Description of shot]
...
```

---

## Recording Instructions (One-Take Delivery)

Most UGC should be filmed in ONE TAKE. Don't restart if you stumble—it makes it more real.

Include these instructions with every script:

### Standard Recording Instructions:

```
RECORDING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. SETUP: Phone propped on nightstand or shelf. Natural lighting. No ring light. Wear what you'd actually wear at home.

2. EYELINE: Look at the camera lens like you're FaceTiming a friend, not presenting.

3. ENERGY: You're venting to a mate. Not selling. Not performing. If it feels like an ad, start again.

4. PRODUCT HOLD: Don't present the bottle like a QVC host. Hold it like you grabbed it off your nightstand to show someone.

5. PACING: No rush. Pause where you naturally would. Say "like" and "um" if that's how you talk.

6. STUMBLES: Keep them. Real people stumble. It builds trust.

7. END ENERGY: Throwaway. You don't care if they buy it. You're just sharing what worked.
```

### Script-Specific Instructions:

Add any moments unique to the script:
- Energy shifts (e.g., "The 'bang' moment is where energy changes from tired to surprised")
- Emotional beats (e.g., "Let genuine frustration show here")
- Physical actions (e.g., "Snap fingers or gesture on 'bang'")

## Language Guidelines

### Write Like People Actually Talk

UGC must sound like a real person, not a script. Read it out loud—if it sounds like an ad, rewrite it.

**Cringy phrases to AVOID:**
- "But honestly the biggest thing?"
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let me tell you..."
- "I'm not gonna lie..."
- "Game changer"
- "Life changing"
- "I can't recommend this enough"
- "You guys..."
- "So basically..."

**Natural alternatives:**
- "But what's wild is..."
- "And like..."
- "The weird part is..."
- "I was shocked because..."
- "No but seriously..."

### Smooth Bridges

Every transition should feel like natural conversation flow, not a script pivot.

**Bad bridges:**
- "But honestly the biggest thing?"
- "Now let me tell you about..."
- "Here's why this is different..."
- "The best part is..."

**Good bridges:**
- "But what's wild is..."
- "And I didn't expect this but..."
- "The thing that got me though..."
- "But within [X days] of taking this—"

### Visceral Benefit Language

Don't say "I was tired." Say "I felt like I'd been hit by a truck."

**Weak language → Strong language:**
- "I was tired" → "I was waking up wanting to die"
- "I couldn't focus" → "I forgot my kid had a middle name"
- "I felt better" → "I actually felt like a person again"
- "It helped me sleep" → "Bang. 10 minutes. Out cold."
- "I had more energy" → "My brain actually worked in the morning"
- "I was stressed" → "My brain was screaming at me"
- "It improved my skin" → "People started asking if I got work done"

### Specific Details = Believability

Vague claims feel fake. Specific details feel real.

**Vague → Specific:**
- "I couldn't sleep" → "I was lying there for two hours every night, eyes closed, brain racing"
- "It worked fast" → "First night—20 minutes. I was out."
- "I saw results" → "By week two I stopped waking up at 3am"
- "I tried everything" → "I tried the teas, the sprays, the pills—nothing"

### Energy Shifts

Mark moments where tone/energy changes:
- Before = tired, frustrated, defeated
- After product = surprised, genuine disbelief
- CTA = throwaway, almost dismissive

Use words like "Bang" or actions like [snaps fingers] to mark the shift.

---

## Market Sophistication & Product Intro Timing

### Fresh Market
- Can build problem for 20-30 seconds before product
- Education is welcome
- More traditional structure works

### Moderate Market  
- Product intro by 15-20 seconds
- Need differentiation angle
- Some problem setup, but don't dwell

### Saturated Market
- Product intro within 8-12 seconds
- No patience for long problem builds
- Hook must pattern interrupt immediately
- Get to "this changed it" fast
- Benefits > problem dwelling
- If they're still watching at 10 seconds, they know the problem—sell the solution
