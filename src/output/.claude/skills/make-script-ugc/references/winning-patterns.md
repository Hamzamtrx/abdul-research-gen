# Winning Patterns for UGC Scripts

## Core UGC Principles

### UGC vs Podcast - Key Differences

| Element | Podcast | UGC |
|---------|---------|-----|
| People | 2 hosts | 1 person |
| Dialogue | Back and forth | Monologue to camera |
| Authority | Expert explains | Personal experience OR "my doctor said" |
| Visuals | Talking heads | Physical demonstrations, B-roll |
| Feel | Overheard conversation | Direct confession to viewer |
| Pacing | Can be slower, educational | Must hook in 3 seconds |

### The UGC Authenticity Formula

**Authentic UGC = Personal story + Specific details + Emotional moments + Imperfect delivery**

- Use "I" and "my" throughout
- Include specific numbers (dates, prices, measurements)
- Show vulnerability ("I almost cried", "That broke my heart")
- Natural speech patterns (pauses, corrections, emphasis)

## Format-Specific Patterns

### Transformation Story Patterns

**Opening formulas:**
- "[Timeframe] ago, I was [desperate state]. Now [transformed state]."
- "See this? This was me [timeframe] ago. [Description of low point]."
- "I'm going to show you something. [Before photo]. That was me."

**Failed solutions montage:**
- "I tried [solution 1], [solution 2], [solution 3]. Nothing worked."
- "I spent $[amount] on [solution]. Lost [small result], gained back [more]."
- "My doctor kept increasing my medication. Then adding another one."

**Discovery moment:**
- "Then my [authority figure - daughter/doctor/friend] told me about..."
- "That's when I found out about..."
- "I was desperate and researched obsessively. That's when I discovered..."

**Results timeline:**
- "Week one: [first change]"
- "Week two: [bigger change]"
- "By week three: [visible transformation]"
- "A month in: [the payoff]"

**Proof point (the clincher):**
- "Here's how I REALLY knew it was working: I ran out for a few days, and [problem came back]."
- "That's when I knew. This wasn't placebo. This was real."

---

### Reverse Selling Patterns

**Opening formulas:**
- "Do NOT buy [product] if you're happy with [competitors]."
- "Stop buying [competitors] unless you're ready for this..."
- "Don't buy [product] if you like [negative thing about competitors]."

**Warning framing:**
- "Because once you put this on, you can't go back."
- "You'll get pissed you didn't know this sooner."
- "I warned you."

**Future pacing:**
- "Let me tell you what happens in 6 months..."
- "Fast forward to [timeframe] later..."
- "You'll become that annoying person who won't shut up about [product]."

**Competitor destruction:**
- "Your [competitor]? That's [percentage] [bad ingredient]. That's [vivid negative description]."
- "You're literally paying $[price] to [negative outcome]."

**Confidence markers:**
- Arrogant tone
- "You won't believe me until it happens."
- "Your friends will get tired of hearing about it. You won't care."

### Medical Story Patterns

**Authority establishment:**
- "My [authority - cardiologist/doctor/nurse daughter] said..."
- "He/she picked it up and said, 'Is this what you've been [using]?'"
- "His/her face went pale."

**Medical drama:**
- Specific numbers: "170 over 95. Those were my numbers."
- Hospital details: "I ended up in the cardiac unit."
- Doctor quotes: "'Robert, can I show you something?'"

**Mechanism via authority:**
- "He/she explained that [common solution] actually [causes problem]."
- "He/she said, 'Most of my patients have this same problem.'"
- "Then he/she said something that gave me hope..."

**Medical proof:**
- Follow-up appointment results
- Doctor validation: "'Good. This is exactly what I hoped would happen.'"
- Specific improved numbers

---

### 30-Day Results Patterns

**Opening formula:**
- "Here's what actually happens to your [problem area] if you [solution] for 30 days."

**Week-by-week structure:**
- "The first thing you'll notice is [most visible change]."
- "By week two, [next change]."
- "By week three, [bigger change]."
- "And by week four, [the transformation everyone wants]."

**Mechanism weaving:**
- "Why? Because [ingredient] is packed with [nutrients] that [mechanism]."
- "[Organ/ingredient] is loaded with [nutrient] that [function]."

**Personal validation:**
- "I know because I lived it."
- "I tried [other solutions]. But once I [used product], [transformation]."

---

### Stitch to Viral Patterns

**Opening formulas:**
- "If anyone sees this woman right here, tell her I'm looking for her."
- "Because thanks to what she said here..."
- "When I first saw this, I thought she had to be lying."

**Skepticism to belief:**
- "I thought she was lying. Either she [extreme explanation] or she's on [competitor]."
- "But then I looked at all the reviews... mind blowing."
- "So I gave it a shot..."

**Results reveal:**
- "And I'll just let my results speak for themselves."
- "[Before description]. And that's me [after]."
- "Nothing has worked like [product] to [benefit]."

[sits on edge of bed, pained expression]
[gets emotional, pauses]
```

### Camera Position Examples
```
[selfie style - face fills frame]

[walking and talking - dynamic movement]
[sitting at table - conversational]
[standing in bathroom mirror]
[kitchen counter - product in frame]
```

### Transition Cues
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Script Mistakes
- ❌ Starting with "Hey guys" or "So today I want to talk about..."
- ❌ Mentioning product in first 3 seconds (for unaware audiences)
- ❌ No visual cues or action directions
- ❌ Reading energy instead of conversational
- ❌ Multiple CTAs throughout
- ❌ Vague claims ("it made me feel better")
- ❌ Cringy bridges ("But honestly the biggest thing?")
- ❌ Weak benefit language ("I was tired" instead of "I felt like death")
- ❌ Too long before product intro in saturated markets

### Production Mistakes
- ❌ No B-roll list
- ❌ No creator requirements
- ❌ No delivery notes
- ❌ Only one hook option
- ❌ Missing items needed list
- ❌ No recording instructions

### Authenticity Mistakes
- ❌ Too polished/scripted sounding
- ❌ No specific details (dates, numbers, places)
- ❌ No emotional moments
- ❌ No proof point (the "ran out and it came back" moment)
- ❌ Sounds like an ad, not a person venting

## Organic Language Guide

### Cringy Phrases to Kill

Never use these—they scream "scripted":

| Kill This | Replace With |
|-----------|--------------|
| "But honestly the biggest thing?" | "But what's wild is..." |
| "Here's the thing..." | "And like..." |
| "Let me tell you..." | [Just say the thing] |
| "Game changer" | "This actually worked" |
| "I can't recommend this enough" | "I'm just mad I didn't find it sooner" |
| "The best part is..." | "The thing that got me though..." |
| "Now let me explain..." | [Just explain] |

### Smooth Bridge Examples

**Problem → Product:**
- "But within 3 days of taking this—"
- "Then I tried this."
- "Someone told me about this and I was skeptical but—"

**Product → Benefit:**
- "And what's wild is..."
- "But the thing that got me..."
- "I didn't expect this but..."

**Benefit → CTA:**
- "30-night guarantee. Didn't work? Send it back. Whatever."
- "I'm just annoyed no one told me earlier."
- "I wish I'd found this like a year ago."

### Visceral Language Bank

**Sleep/Energy:**
- "Felt like I'd been hit by a truck"
- "Waking up wanting to die"
- "Brain screaming at me"
- "Dragging myself through the morning"
- "Actually felt like a person"
- "Bang. 10 minutes. Out cold."

**Pain/Discomfort:**
- "Couldn't walk without holding furniture"
- "Dreading that first step every morning"
- "I almost cried"
- "The pain came roaring back"

**Brain Fog/Focus:**
- "Forgot my kid had a middle name"
- "Forgot my own PIN"
- "Completely useless by 2pm"
- "My brain actually works now"

**Weight/Appearance:**
- "Crying at my wedding dress fitting"
- "Couldn't look at photos of myself"
- "People started asking what I was doing"

### Specific Details That Build Trust

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "It worked fast" | "First night. 20 minutes. Out." |
| "I saw results" | "By week two I stopped waking at 3am" |
| "I tried everything" | "Teas, sprays, the gummies, nothing" |
| "For a while" | "For 8 months" |
| "It was expensive" | "I spent $300 on specialists" |
| "I felt bad" | "I was lying there for 2 hours, eyes closed, brain racing" |

## Recording Instructions Template

Include with every script:

```
RECORDING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. SETUP: Phone propped up. Natural lighting. No ring light. Wear what you'd actually wear at home.

2. EYELINE: Camera lens = FaceTime with a friend. Not presenting.

3. ENERGY: Venting to a mate. Not selling. If it feels like an ad, restart.

4. PRODUCT HOLD: Grabbed off nightstand, not QVC presentation.

5. PACING: Pause naturally. "Like" and "um" are fine.

6. STUMBLES: Keep them. Real people stumble.

7. END ENERGY: Throwaway. You don't care if they buy.

## Brief Structure

Every script needs:

**ANGLE:** Single specific angle being tested
- Good: "Brain fog so bad you forget basic things → sleep fixed in days"
- Bad: "Sleep problems / tiredness / can't focus" (too broad)

**UGC STYLE:** Which format
- Transformation / Reverse Selling / Medical Story / 30-Day Results / Stitch to Viral

**HYPOTHESIS:** Why this will work
- What pattern interrupt are we using?
- Why this hook for this audience?
- Why this structure for this market sophistication?
- What are we testing that we can learn from?

If the angle wins, you should know EXACTLY what worked so you can iterate.
