---

**SCRIPT:**

[tired, straight to camera]
"I forgot my kid had a middle name. That's how bad my sleep was. I was waking up every morning feeling like I'd been hit by a truck."

[holds up Dremteam]
"But within 3 days of taking this—"

[snaps or gestures - energy shift]
"Bang. 10 minutes. Out cold. That literally never happens to me."

[taps bottle, casual]
"It's called Dremteam. Magnesium, l-theanine, tart cherry—stuff that actually calms your brain down instead of just knocking you out."

[genuine, like she's surprised]
"But what's wild is I wake up and I'm actually there. Like my brain works in the morning. I'm not dragging myself around wanting to cry before 9am."

[shows tape + strips]
"They've got mouth tape and nasal strips too. Sounds mental but it stops you mouth breathing so you don't wake up feeling like death."

[shrugs, throwaway]
"30-night guarantee. Didn't work? Send it back. Whatever."

[half laugh]
"I'm just annoyed no one told me about this earlier."

---

**B-ROLL NEEDED:**
1. Lying in bed frustrated, eyes open
2. Groggy morning - rubbing face
3. Product on nightstand
4. Waking up naturally, alert

---

**RECORDING INSTRUCTIONS:**

Film this in ONE TAKE. Don't restart if you stumble—it makes it more real.

1. **Setup:** Phone propped on nightstand or shelf. Natural lighting. No ring light. Wear what you'd actually wear at home.

2. **Eyeline:** Look at the camera lens like you're FaceTiming a friend, not presenting.

3. **Energy:** You're tired and venting to a mate. Not selling. Not performing. If it feels like an ad, start again.

4. **Product hold:** Don't present the bottle like a QVC host. Hold it like you grabbed it off your nightstand to show someone.

5. **The "bang" moment:** This is the energy shift. Before = tired and frustrated. After = genuine surprise it worked.

6. **Pacing:** No rush. Pause where you naturally would. Say "like" and "um" if that's how you talk.

7. **End energy:** Throwaway. You don't care if they buy it. You're just sharing.

---

**DELIVERY NOTES:**
- "Forgot my kid had a middle name" should land like a joke you're embarrassed about
- "Bang. 10 minutes. Out cold." = genuine disbelief, energy shift
- "Wanting to cry before 9am" = keep this real, slightly dark humour
- "Sounds mental" = natural skepticism acknowledgment
- Never sound like you're reading

---

**WORD COUNT:** ~150 words (~40-45 seconds)

**Why this works:**
- Saturated market = product intro in 8 seconds
- Absurd specific detail hooks ("forgot kid's middle name")
- Visceral language throughout ("hit by a truck", "wanting to cry")
- Smooth bridges ("But within 3 days", "But what's wild is")
- Energy shift clearly marked ("Bang")

[pause, let it land]
"And about four months after that, I had lost 60 pounds. Now I'm a size 4."

[skeptical expression]
"When I first saw it, I thought she had to be lying. Either she works out like crazy or she's on that secret jab. You know, the one that rhymes with olympic. Yeah, that one."

**HOOK 3:**

[holds up Gatorade]

---

**SCRIPT:**

[shows swollen ankles to camera]
"If your ankles look like this..."

[mimics grabbing wall]
"You're so dizzy you have to grab the wall when you stand up..."

[frustrated expression]
"And you're peeing ten times a night..."

[holds up Gatorade bottle]
"And you're taking blood pressure medication with THIS... you need to watch this."

[selfie style, serious]
"Because my cardiologist's face went pale when he saw what I'd been drinking with my medicine."

[settles in, story mode]
"My name is Robert. I'm 55 years old. And last March, I ended up in the cardiac unit."

"Not for a heart attack, thank God. But for blood pressure so high the ER doctor said I was 'one bad day away from a stroke.'"

"170 over 95. Those were my numbers when they admitted me. The nurse took it three times because she didn't believe it."

[cutting fruit while talking - keeps visual interest]
"And it was wild because I was doing everything right. Taking my medication every morning. Walking every day. Eating no sugar. And most importantly, staying hydrated with Gatorade. Two bottles a day."

[frustrated]
"For six months before that hospital stay, my blood pressure kept climbing. My doctor kept increasing my medication. Then he added a diuretic—a water pill to help flush out the sodium."

"I was on THREE blood pressure medications. Three. And I felt terrible."

[emotional, listing symptoms]
"My ankles were so swollen I couldn't tie my shoes. I had to wear slip-ons like a toddler. I was dizzy all the time. I'd stand up and the room would spin."

"And the bathroom. Oh my God, the bathroom. I was up ten, twelve times a night. My wife started sleeping in the guest room because I kept waking her up."

[defeated]
"I thought, 'This is it. This is what getting old looks like. This is my life now.'"

[dramatic shift]
"Then one morning, I woke up and couldn't catch my breath. My chest felt tight. My wife called 911."

[phone set down - shows doctor interaction reenactment]
"Dr. Ramirez, the cardiologist, came to review my chart. He saw the Gatorade on my bedside table."

"He picked it up and said, 'Is this what you've been drinking for electrolytes?'"

[mimics conversation]
"I said, 'Every day. Sometimes two bottles. My doctor said to stay hydrated.'"

"His face went pale. He sat down on the edge of my bed and said, 'Robert, can I show you something?'"

[educational, quoting doctor]
"He said, 'See this number? 500 milligrams of sodium. Per bottle. For 25-year-old athletes who sweat profusely. Not for 55-year-olds with hypertension on diuretics.'"

"'You've been consuming 1,000 milligrams of extra sodium daily. On top of your regular diet.'"

[realization]
"He said, 'Your diuretic is trying to flush out sodium. You're drinking this and putting it right back in. Your body can't win.'"

[holds up Nectar packet]
"Then he told me about this. Nectar. 100 milligrams of sodium—five times less than sports drinks. Plus potassium, magnesium, and calcium to actually balance everything."

[results timeline - counting on fingers, getting animated]
"Week one: The swelling in my ankles started going down. I could tie my shoes again."

"Week two: I wasn't dizzy anymore. I could stand up without grabbing the wall."

"Week three: I was only getting up twice a night to pee. Not ten times. Twice. My wife moved back into our bedroom."

[gets emotional]
"My follow-up appointment was at six weeks. Dr. Ramirez took my blood pressure twice. Then a third time."

"He said, 'Robert, these numbers are excellent. 112 over 78. What changed?'"

[holds up Nectar]
"I showed him this. He nodded and said, 'Good. This is exactly what I hoped would happen. Keep doing what you're doing.'"

[direct to camera, urgent]
"So if you're on blood pressure medication—especially a diuretic—and you're drinking sports drinks for electrolytes... you're doing what I did. You're fighting yourself."

"Nectar has 100 milligrams of sodium. It's 86 cents per serving. Cheaper than Gatorade. And it's designed for people like us—not athletes."

"There's a 90-day guarantee. If it doesn't help, you get your money back."

[warm close]
"The link is below. Your heart will thank you. Your ankles will thank you. And you might just find yourself chasing grandkids again."

---

**SCRIPT:**

[flexing, confident to camera]
"Do NOT buy UndrDog shirts if you're happy with BYLT, True Classic, or Lululemon."

"Because once you put this on, you can't go back."

[gestures to shirt, flexes arms]
"It'll grip your arms and hide your gut. You'll look jacked instantly."

"Then you'll wear it for a few hours and realize you're not sweating through it. Because the bamboo in it pulls moisture 3x faster than cotton. No pit stains. No sweat patches."

[vapes under shirt, shows smoke coming through]
"Let me prove it."

[blows through shirt]
"See that? That's real breathability."

[shows label]
"You'll check the label: 51% hemp, 31% bamboo, 18% organic cotton."

[competitive, dismissive]
"And you'll start to compare. Your BYLT shirt? That's 67% polyester. That's plastic wrapped around your torso."

[serious, direct]
"When you sweat, PFAS chemicals from that plastic leach into your bloodstream. Low testosterone. Fertility issues. Cancer. You're literally paying $45 to shrink your balls."

[points at camera]
"You'll get pissed you didn't know this sooner."

[future pacing]
"Let's fast forward to 6 months later. Your True Classic, BYLT, Dickies shirts are shrinking, look like shit. Your UndrDog shirt still looks brand new."

"That's when you'll realize you may never need the lifetime guarantee it comes with."

[value math]
"You'll do the math: $37 for a shirt that lasts a lifetime."

"You'll throw out your entire wardrobe. BYLT, True Classic, Lululemon, all of it."

[social proof, smirking]
"Random women on the street will start complimenting you."

"You know I gave this shirt to my friend who just got divorced? He doesn't call it Undrdog. He literally calls it the 'get lucky' shirt."

[obvious wink]
"Because you know..."

[confident]
"You'll think I'm lying until it happens. Then you'll become that annoying guy who won't shut up about hemp shirts. Your friends will get tired of hearing about it."

"You won't care."

"Because you don't even give a fuck about hemp. You just know this shirt feels better, looks better, and doesn't poison you."

[return to reverse frame]
"So yeah, do NOT buy UndrDog if you're happy with BYLT, True Classic, or Lululemon."

"But if you're done with plastic garbage, pit stains, and shrinking your balls..."

## FORMAT: 30-Day Results

### Example: Double Chin / Chubby Face (Primal Queen)
**Awareness Level:** Problem Aware
**Format:** 30-Day Results

---

**CREATOR NEEDED:**
- Gender: Female
- Age: 30-45
- Persona: Relatable woman who fixed facial bloating

**ITEMS NEEDED:**
- Primal Queen bottle

---

**HOOK 1:**
Here's what actually happens to your chubby face if you eat beef organs for 30 days.

**HOOK 2:**
That stubborn fat around your chin? Here's what makes it finally disappear.

---

**SCRIPT:**

[direct to camera]
"Here's what actually happens to your chubby face if you eat beef organs for 30 days."

[educational, pointing to chin area]
"The first thing you'll notice is that stubborn fat around your chin. The double chin that just won't go away starts to shrink."

"Why? Because organs aren't just random proteins. Each one is packed with nutrients that control how your body stores fat."

[mechanism education]
"Liver is loaded with natural vitamin A and B12 that fires up your metabolism and helps your body burn fat instead of holding onto it."

"Kidney is rich in iron. When your iron is balanced, your thyroid works properly—and that means your body stops storing weight around your face and neck."

"Then you got ovaries and uterus. They're full of B vitamins and selenium that directly support female hormones. And when your hormones are balanced, your face isn't as puffy. Your chin doesn't hold that water weight and that fat finally starts to move."

[week-by-week results]
"By week two, your skin looks tighter and the puffiness is down."

"By week three, you'll feel it in your jawline—less sag, more definition."

"And by week four, the double chin that showed up in every photo? It's noticeably smaller and you finally start feeling confident in pictures again."

[personal validation]
"I know because I lived it. I tried the diets, the powders, nothing worked. But once I went back to what women ate for thousands of years—beef organs—my whole face and body changed."

[product + CTA]
"It's easy with Primal Queen. Two peppermint-scented capsules a day, six female-focused organs, and no more wasting money on quick fixes that don't work."

---

**B-ROLL NEEDED:**
1. Before: face looking bloated/puffy
2. After: defined jawline, confident
3. Pointing to chin/jaw area
4. Product hero shot
5. Taking capsules

**DELIVERY NOTES:**
- Educational but personal
- Week-by-week should build excitement
- "I know because I lived it" = authentic moment
- End confident, not salesy

## FORMAT: Authority + Transformation

### Example: Arthritis / Joint Pain (Bioroot Labs)
**Awareness Level:** Problem Aware
**Format:** Medical Story + Transformation

---

**CREATOR NEEDED:**
- Age: 60-70 (must be visibly this age)
- Gender: Female
- Persona: "Grateful Survivor"
- Energy: Raw, emotional, authentic

**ITEMS NEEDED:**
- Bioroot Labs turmeric bottle
- Furniture to hold onto (for demonstration)

---

**HOOK 1:**
Six months ago, I couldn't walk across a room without holding onto furniture.

**HOOK 2:**
See this? This was me six months ago. Holding onto furniture just to walk across a room. Now look. No pain. No furniture. Just me, moving like a normal person again.

---

**SCRIPT:**

[phone set down - shows holding furniture, walking painfully]
"Six months ago, I couldn't walk across a room without holding onto furniture."

[walks freely]
"Now look. No pain. No furniture. Just me, moving like a normal person again."

"And it's all because I finally figured out why turmeric didn't work for me before."

[picks up phone - selfie style, close up, serious]
"The arthritis in my hips, back and knees was unbearable. Some mornings, I'd sit on the edge of my bed for twenty minutes, dreading that first step. I was 62 years old and felt like I was 90."

[emotional]
"I almost quit my job. I couldn't keep up. And the thought of not being able to play with my grandkids? That broke my heart."

[phone set down - shows moving freely]
"Now look at me. My goodness I haven't been able to move like this for so long."

[back to selfie - failed solutions]
"I used to take Ibuprofen every day and my doctor warned me about the side effects. Physical therapy helped a little, but the pain always came back. I even asked my doctor if I'd eventually need surgery."

"Then my daughter, who's a nurse, told me about this specific turmeric supplement."

[skepticism]
"Now, I'd tried turmeric powder before. I'd put it in my tea, mix it into smoothies, even tried golden milk every morning. Did that for months. And to be honest, it didn't do a thing for my pain."

[educational - the mechanism]
"She explained that regular turmeric powder only has about 3% curcumin—that's the active compound. So to get a therapeutic dose, you'd need to take like 30 grams of powder every single day. That's like ten teaspoons. No way I could do that."

"That's why even ayurvedic practitioners use concentrated extracts."

[holds up product, rattles it naturally]
"This one here has 95% curcuminoids. It also has black pepper extract and MCT oil. The black pepper boosts absorption by up to 2000%. And the MCT oil carries it into your cells because curcumin is fat-soluble."

"Without that, your body can't actually absorb the turmeric. It just goes right through you."

[gradual results - key to credibility]
"I've been taking three capsules every day for three months now. And honestly, the change was gradual. I didn't have this big 'aha' moment. I just started feeling... better. Less stiff in the mornings. Easier to get up from a chair."

[the proof moment - emotional]
"But about a month in, I drove six hours to see my grandkids. When I got out of the car, I was unpacking, carrying the bags and moving around. And it took me like an hour to realize I wasn't in pain. My back didn't hurt. My knees didn't hurt. I was just moving. Like a normal person."

[almost crying]
"I almost cried."

[the clincher - ran out proof]
"And here's how I REALLY knew it was working: I ran out for a few days last month, and the pain came roaring back. My hips, my back, my knees. I was holding onto furniture again."

[direct, conviction]
"That's when I knew. This wasn't placebo. This was real."

[CTA with urgency]
"Now, fair warning. BioRoot Labs is a small, independent company. They're not some massive corporation. They sell out pretty often because they refuse to cut corners on quality. So if it's in stock when you click the link, grab it. You'll thank yourself in a few weeks."

[warm close]
"And please stay consistent. I hope you feel better soon."

---

**B-ROLL NEEDED:**
1. Walking painfully, holding furniture (re-enactment)

3. Walking freely, happily
