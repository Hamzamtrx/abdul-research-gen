# Universal Script Patterns - Cross-Category Insights

This file contains patterns, structures, and principles that work across ALL winning scripts regardless of product category. Use these as the foundation for any script generation.

---

## THE 10/10 SCRIPT ANATOMY

Every winning script follows this core structure (timing may vary by format):

```
1. HOOK (3-5 seconds) → Stop the scroll
2. AUTHORITY (8-12 seconds) → Why listen to this person
3. PROBLEM EXPANSION (10-15 seconds) → Make problem feel bigger
4. MECHANISM EDUCATION (15-20 seconds) → Explain WHY problem exists
5. SOLUTION REVEAL (5-8 seconds) → Introduce product naturally
6. SOCIAL PROOF (10-15 seconds) → Show it works for others
7. BENEFIT STACK (8-12 seconds) → What life looks like after
8. COMPETITIVE DESTRUCTION (10-15 seconds) → Why other solutions fail
9. CTA (5-8 seconds) → Where to get + urgency
```

**Total: 45-90 seconds depending on format**

## UNIVERSAL AUTHORITY MECHANISMS

### 1. Personal Long-Term Use
**Pattern**: "I've taken it myself every day for [X years]"
- **Why it works**: Personal stake = credibility
- **Key**: Must be LONG term (5+ years ideal, minimum 1 year)
- **Examples**: 
  - "I've taken it myself, every day for over 10 years"
  - "This has been my daily ritual for 7 years"

### 2. Professional Experience + Patient Success
**Pattern**: "I've been recommending this for [timeframe] to [specific audience], and [emotional outcome] later they [result]"
- **Why it works**: Dual proof (expertise + repeated results)
- **Key**: Specific audience + emotional reaction
- **Examples**:
  - "I've been recommending for years to people at 40, 50 years old who are exhausted, and three weeks later, they always come back in tears thanking me"

### 3. Credentials + Insider Knowledge
**Pattern**: "[Title/Background] + I see [problem] all the time"
- **Why it works**: Authority from position + pattern recognition
- **Examples**:
  - "As a functional nurse, I see this in 70% of my patients"
  - "After 15 years in the industry, I finally found..."

### 4. Personal Rock Bottom + Discovery
**Pattern**: "I was at [lowest point with specific details], tried [everything], then discovered [solution]"
- **Why it works**: Relatability + credibility through shared struggle
- **Key**: Rock bottom must be SPECIFIC and multi-faceted
- **Examples**:
  - "I was at all time low - I had just broke my back, my grandma was sick, I just came off 9 years of mat leave"

### 5. Ancestral/Historical Wisdom
**Pattern**: "Our ancestors [used this] for [timeframe] and they didn't have [modern problem]"
- **Why it works**: Evolutionary proof, return to natural wisdom
- **Examples**:
  - "We've been eating beef organs for 1000s of years and they didn't have depression, fatigue, or weight issues"

---

## UNIVERSAL MECHANISM EDUCATION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Deficiency Framework
**Structure**: 
```
Most people have [condition] because your body is missing [specific nutrients].

Without [nutrient 1], [system 1] can't [function].
Without [nutrient 2], [system 2] [failure metaphor].
Without [nutrient 3], [hormone/function] [failure metaphor].

When you're deficient, you [symptom 1], [symptom 2], and [consequence] even if you're doing everything right.
```

**Why it works**: Removes personal blame, identifies fixable root cause

**Examples**:
- "Your adrenal glands stop regulating cortisol properly because your body is missing essential nutrients"
- "Without magnesium, muscles fire like wet matches. Without zinc, the brain processes like Windows 95."

---

### Pattern 2: Survival Mode Framework
**Structure**:
```
Your body went into survival mode. It [protective mechanism] thinking '[protective thought]'.

That's why [all your efforts] did nothing. Without [key nutrient], your body couldn't get the signal that it was safe to [release problem].
```

**Why it works**: Reframes body as protective (not enemy), explains why efforts failed

**Examples**:
- "Your body went into survival mode. It slowed your metabolism and held onto every bit of fat thinking 'What if we need this later?'"

---

### Pattern 3: System Failure Framework
**Structure**:
```
[Body system] controls [multiple functions]. When it's broken from [cause], [cascading failures].

Most people don't realize [seemingly unrelated symptoms] are all connected to [root system failure].
```

**Why it works**: Shows interconnection, explains multiple symptoms

**Examples**:
- "Your hormones control everything - weight, mood, energy, confidence. When they're broken, you're fighting a losing battle."

---

### Pattern 4: Like-For-Like Framework
**Structure**:
```
Science says that like for like, when you [consume X], it actually helps [corresponding body part/system].

So [eating/taking specific organ/part] helps your own [matching system] by [mechanism].
```

**Why it works**: Intuitive logic, makes sense even if simplified

**Examples**:
- "When you eat a uterus, it's helping your own uterus by giving it a B12 boost and managing those hormones"

---

## UNIVERSAL NUTRITIONAL COMPARISON PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: The Extreme Multiplier
**Structure**: "[Product ingredient] has [X times] more [nutrient] than [common healthy food]"
- **Key**: Use shocking multipliers (4x minimum, 100x+ ideal)
- **Compare to**: Spinach, kale, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower
- **Why it works**: Makes inadequacy of "healthy eating" obvious

**Examples**:
- "Beef liver has 100x more B12 than spinach"
- "Beef heart has 14,000x more COQ10 than cauliflower"
- "23 times more iron than spinach"

### Pattern 2: The Comprehensive Nutrient Profile
**Structure**: "[Product] is packed with [X] out of [Y] essential nutrients including [list 3-4 key ones]"
- **Key**: Large number out of total shows comprehensiveness
- **Why it works**: Positions as complete solution

**Examples**:
- "Packed with 92 out of the 102 essential nutrients that your body needs including potassium, magnesium, iron, and B vitamins"

### Pattern 3: Nature's Original Multivitamin
**Structure**: "[Product] is nature's original multivitamin - [list impressive comparisons]"
- **Why it works**: Reframes as natural vs. synthetic alternatives

**Examples**:
- "Beef organs are nature's original multivitamin. The amount of nutrients in a beef liver is crazy."

---

## UNIVERSAL SOCIAL PROOF STRUCTURES

### Type 1: Emotional Patient Testimonial
**Pattern**: Specific person + multiple failed attempts + transformation + emotional reaction
```
I had a [patient/client] who had [problem 1], [problem 2], [problem 3], and was relying on [temporary solution] every day.

[He/She] tried everything. [Failed solution 1], [failed solution 2], even [expensive/extreme solution].

After [timeframe] on [product], [he/she] [emotional reaction].

[Specific transformation 1]. [Specific transformation 2]. [Specific transformation 3 with lifestyle detail].
```

**Why it works**: Shows this works when everything else failed, specific details create believability

---

### Type 2: Personal Transformation Stack
**Pattern**: Multiple life areas improved with specific details
```
I couldn't [problem 1] for [timeframe], now [transformation 1].

[Specific consequence of problem 2], now [transformation 2].

My [intimate/personal area] [negative state] for [long timeframe], now [positive state compared to best years].
```

**Why it works**: Shows comprehensive life improvement, not just one metric

---

### Type 3: Observable Reality Check
**Pattern**: Point out what's happening around them
```
[Observable percentage/fraction] of [location/group] [struggling behavior].

That [common experience everyone has]? That's [root cause].

The [person type] who can't [basic function]? [Their system] is [metaphor].
```

**Why it works**: Makes problem undeniable by pointing at reality

---

### Type 4: Professional Pattern Recognition
**Pattern**: Expert noting frequency
```
I see this all the time. [Percentage] of [demographic] have [problem].

With the current state of [population], I'd be surprised if this didn't work for at least [percentage]% of the population.
```

**Why it works**: Large-scale validation from authority

---

## UNIVERSAL COMPETITIVE DESTRUCTION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Pre-emptive Warning
**Structure**:
```
But before you go buy any [product category], there's one thing you need to know.

Most [product category] supplements? Not helpful. Too [problem 1]. Too [problem 2].

Filled with [bad ingredient], [bad ingredient], or [bad ingredient] that don't belong in your body.

I tried dozens. And I saw [my patients/clients] wasting money on brands that didn't deliver.
```

**Why it works**: Positions your brand as THE safe choice before they even search

---

### Pattern 2: The Failed Solutions Montage
**Structure**:
```
Watch these guys trying to fix it.

[Solution 1] turned them into [negative outcome].
[Solution 2] gave them [negative outcome].
They're spending [ridiculous $] on [low-quality source].
Taking [trendy nonsense] their [unlikely authority] recommended.

Still [problem]. Still [problem]. Still wondering why nothing works.
```

**Why it works**: Validates their frustration, shows you understand their journey

---

### Pattern 3: The Root Cause Truth Bomb
**Structure**:
```
Nobody told you the truth: You can't [overcome problem] with [common solution].

Because [fundamental reason].

Unless you [go to actual source/fix root cause].
```

**Why it works**: Explains WHY other solutions failed

**Examples**:
- "You can't out-supplement soil depletion. Unless you go straight to the source."

---

### Pattern 4: Quality Specification
**Structure**:
```
To make sure you're getting [quality product] that actually [works], it must be:
- [Specification 1]
- [Specification 2]
- [Specification 3]

The only brand I know that meets that standard is [brand name].
```

**Why it works**: Sets criteria that only your product meets

---

## UNIVERSAL CTA STRUCTURES

### CTA Type 1: Risk Reversal + Scarcity
**Pattern**:
```
[X]-day money-back guarantee - because I'm confident it will work for you.

The only problem is [scarcity reason].

So I want to apologize because if you click the link, you might see [sold out/limited].
```

**Why it works**: Removes risk, creates FOMO, apology frame seems helpful not pushy

---

### CTA Type 2: Soft Recommendation + Value Stack
**Pattern**:
```
I mean, try [it/mine] for [timeframe] and see how you feel.

They have a [X]-day money-back guarantee [+ additional value items].

You have nothing to lose [really/honestly].
```

**Why it works**: Friend recommendation feel, emphasizes zero risk

---

### CTA Type 3: Defiant Call to Action
**Pattern**:
```
Your [ancestor] didn't need [product category]. [His/Her] [food/life] had [quality].

Yours doesn't. But you're not going to accept that.
```

**Why it works**: Masculine, empowering, calls to refuse decline

---

### CTA Type 4: The Quiet Confidence
**Pattern**:
```
90-day guarantee. We know what happens when [starving cells finally eat / you finally fix root cause].

Limited [source] supply. When it's gone, you're back to [synthetic garbage / suboptimal solutions].
```

**Why it works**: Confidence without pressure, scarcity without panic

2. Add 2-3 supporting benefits (different life areas)
3. Include 1 unexpected benefit (bonus)
4. End with emotional/lifestyle benefit (not just physical)

### Format:
```
Just one dose of this [frequency] could help you:

✨ [Mental/emotional benefit]
✨ [Relationship/lifestyle benefit]
✨ [Unexpected bonus]
```

### Keys:
- Use emojis (✨, ✅, 🔥) for visual breaks
- Keep each benefit to one line
- Use specific language ("sleep through the night without waking at 3am" not "better sleep")
- 5-8 benefits maximum

---

## UNIVERSAL OBJECTION HANDLING

### Pre-emptive Objection Handling:
Address concerns BEFORE they become resistance:

**Skepticism about simplicity**:
```
And every time I mention it, I get the look.
Wide eyes. Raised eyebrows. That "[skeptical response]" face.
And honestly? I get it. It sounds too simple.
But [personal evidence].
```

**Practical barriers**:
```
[Objection stated]: "Where am I even meant to get [unusual ingredient]?"
[Acknowledge]: "Yeah, that's a good question."
[Solve]: "I [couldn't stomach it either / had same problem], but [solution]."
```

**Cost concerns**:
```
Most people buy it at regular price, but right now they're doing a special promotion where you can get [discount].
```

**Trust concerns**:
```
[Risk reversal]: [X]-day money-back guarantee
[Social proof]: Thousands of reviews
[Quality markers]: Third-party tested, made in USA
```

3. **Hope**: "This could actually work" (social proof)
4. **Urgency**: "I need to act now" (scarcity, guarantee)

- [ ] Cause-effect chain makes sense?
- [ ] Not "magic" - logical explanation?

### Gate 4: Social Proof Strength
- [ ] Specific transformations (not vague)?
- [ ] Emotional reaction included?
- [ ] Believable details?

### Gate 5: Life-Force 8 Coverage

---

## UNIVERSAL SCRIPT IMPROVEMENT PROTOCOL

When a script is 7/10 (good but not great):

**Step 1: Strengthen the Hook**
- Is it specific enough?
- Can you push it more extreme?
- Does it create immediate curiosity?

**Step 2: Add Specificity**
- Replace vague language with specific details
- Add numbers (timeframes, amounts, percentages)
- Name specific symptoms, places, people

**Step 3: Check Contradictions**
- Read aloud - do claims support each other?
- Is tone consistent?
- Do facts align?

**Step 4: Amplify Social Proof**
- Is transformation dramatic enough?
- Are details specific and believable?
- Is emotional reaction included?

**Step 5: Strengthen Mechanism**
- Is root cause crystal clear?
- Does cause-effect chain make sense?
- Have you created a villain?

---

## FINAL UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE

**The Common Sense Filter:**

Every script must pass this test:

> "Would a regular person in the target audience actually talk like this?"

If language is too:
- **Medical/scientific** → Simplify
- **Sales-y/hype** → Tone down
- **Formal** → Make conversational
- **Collector-coded** → Make accessible

The goal: Sound like an informed friend sharing a discovery, not a marketer selling a product.
