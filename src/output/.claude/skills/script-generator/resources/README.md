## How to Use These Resources

### When Generating Scripts for a NEW Category (e.g., skincare):

1. **Read** `universal_patterns.md` - Understand patterns that work everywhere
2. **Study** supplement examples in `examples/` - See how patterns are applied
3. **Extract** what makes them 10/10 (annotations explain this)
4. **Apply** universal patterns to your new category
5. **Use** `hook_formulas.md` to create scroll-stopping hooks

### When Generating Scripts for Supplements:

1. **Load** relevant example files from `examples/`
2. **Study** annotations to understand why each script works
3. **Pattern match** - use same structures for new product
4. **Reference** `hook_formulas.md` for proven hook templates
5. **Validate** against quality standards in `universal_patterns.md`

## Key Principles from Winning Scripts

### What Makes a Script 10/10:

1. **Hook stops scroll in 3 seconds** - Unexpected + visceral + specific
2. **Authority established early** - Personal use + professional experience
3. **Mechanism education** - Explains WHY, not just what
4. **Social proof is specific** - Names, numbers, emotions
5. **Competitive destruction** - Shows why alternatives fail
6. **Natural product mention** - Not salesy, organic reveal
7. **Multiple life areas** - Not just one benefit
8. **Risk reversal** - 90-365 day guarantees
9. **No hype language** - Conversational, authentic
10. **Hits 3+ Life-Force 8 desires** - Multiple human motivations

### Universal Patterns Across All Winners:

- **Deficiency framework** - You're not broken, you're depleted
- **Ancestral wisdom** - Return to natural solutions
- **Villain creation** - Clear enemy (industry, system, modern food)
- **Root cause education** - Fix problem at source, not symptoms
- **Survival mode reframe** - Body trying to protect, not betray
- **Specific transformations** - Numbers, timeframes, concrete details
- **Failed attempts catalog** - "I tried everything"
- **Emotional validation** - "It wasn't your fault"

## Adding New Category Examples

When you create 10/10 scripts for a NEW category:

1. Create file: `resources/examples/[category]_[format]_winners.md`
   - Example: `skincare_ugc_winners.md`
   - Example: `fitness_podcast_winners.md`

2. Follow same annotation structure:
   - Full script text
   - "WHY THIS SCRIPT WORKS (10/10)" section
   - Numbered breakdowns of each element
   - Template extraction
   - Life-Force 8 analysis
   - Key takeaways

3. Extract category-specific patterns to add to `universal_patterns.md`

## Quality Standards

Every script must pass these gates:

✅ Hook is 8+/10 (would YOU stop scrolling?)
✅ No internal contradictions
✅ Language matches target audience reality
✅ Reads naturally when spoken aloud
✅ Mechanism is clear (not "magic")
✅ Social proof is specific and believable
✅ Hits 3+ Life-Force 8 desires
✅ No forbidden words (amazing, game-changer, miracle, etc.)
✅ CTA has risk reversal
✅ No vague benefits

If ANY gate fails → REWRITE

## Using with Claude Agent SDK

When your script generator agent runs:

1. Agent determines product category
2. Checks if examples exist in `resources/examples/[category]_*.md`
3. If YES → Load examples and pattern-match
4. If NO → Load `universal_patterns.md` and apply to new category
5. Always reference `hook_formulas.md` for hook creation
6. Validate every script against quality gates

## Performance Data (When Available)

When you have performance data for scripts:
- Add to script annotation: `**Performance**: 2.3M views, 4.7% CTR, £12k revenue`
- Helps identify highest-performing patterns
- Informs future script generation

## Maintenance

As you create more 10/10 scripts:
- Add to relevant example files
- Extract new patterns to `universal_patterns.md`
- Update hook formulas with new templates
- Document what's working in the market NOW
